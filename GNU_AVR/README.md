# GNU AVR
This Directory provides a script for generating a basic avr assembly project in a GNU/Linux environment. The project is intialized with a VS Code workspace (my prefered editor), as well as a Makefile. 

## To create a project
`cd template`

`./createProject fooBar`

## To build and flash the executable
`cd fooBar`

`make`

`make flash`
